# WombatBooks

Sample API consumption for Kotare "sharpies" (C# stream students). I developed this during phase 2 of Enspiral Dev Academy when some of my classmates were having some difficulty understanding how to approach consuming an API.

We explored how to build a hierarchy of objects that matched the JSON coming back from the API, then used JSON.NET to instantiate them.
